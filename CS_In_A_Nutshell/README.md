## The definations:

What is C#? C# is a general-purpose, type-safe, object-oriented programming language.

Runtime: The C# language is platform neutral and works with a range of platform-specific
runtimes.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation means creating a boundary around an object to separate its external (public) behavior from its internal (private) implementation details.

Unified type system: The fundamental building block in C# is an encapsulated unit of data and functions called a type.
C# has a unified type system in which all types ultimately share a common base type. This means that all types, whether they represent business objects or are primitive types such as numbers, share the same basic functionality. For example, an instance of any type can be converted to a string by calling its ToString method.

Classes and interfaces
In a traditional object-oriented paradigm, the only kind of type is a class. In C#, there are several other kinds of types, one of which is an interface. An interface is like a class that cannot hold data. This means that it can define only behavior (and not state), which allows for multiple inheritance as well as a separation
between specification and implementation.

high-level abstractions such as: query expressions and asynchronous
continuations

allows low-level efficiency through constructs such as custom value types and optional pointers.
